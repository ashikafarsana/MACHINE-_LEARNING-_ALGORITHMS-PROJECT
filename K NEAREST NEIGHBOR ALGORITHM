How does K-NN work?

Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors
Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors
Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.
Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
Step-6: Our model is ready.

calculate the Euclidean distance between the data points. The Euclidean distance is the distance between two points
 Euclidean distance= sqrt[(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2]
 
 Advantages of KNN Algorithm:
 
It is simple to implement.
It is robust to the noisy training data
It can be more effective if the training data is large.


Disadvantages of KNN Algorithm:

Always needs to determine the value of K which may be complex some time.
The computation cost is high because of calculating the distance between the data points for all the training samples.
